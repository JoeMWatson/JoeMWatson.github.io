I recently completed my Master's in Infomration Engineering at the Unviersity of Cambridge. I'm currently helping [Cambridge Medical Robotics](http://murmure.org/.html) carry out their awesome work and learn how to do proper engineering in the process.

My research interests lie in carrying out visumotor tasks autonomously, understanding and operating in unstructured environments. As a result I am very intereseted in control theory, deep learning, reinforcement learning and computer vision. My creative work is somewhat similar, where I am interested in balancing order and disorder aesthetically. 

If you have any questions please feel free to get in touch.
