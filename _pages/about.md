This blog is designed to be a documentation of my personal research and projects. The aim is to help others learn about the topics I'm interested in, providing the insightful details often missing in typical write ups. 

My research interests lie in carrying out visumotor tasks autonomously, understanding and operating in unstructured environments. As a result I am very intereseted in control theory, deep learning, reinforcement learning and computer vision. My creative work is somewhat similar, where I am interested in balancing order and disorder aesthetically. 

My research is designed to be implemented on a crappy student CPU machine, and I typically use Python/C++/Processing (Java) with TensorFlow and OpenCV.

I recently completed my Master's in Engineering at the Unviersity of Cambridge, where I studied a broad range of engineering disciplines but eventually focused on robotics, studying control, signal processing and machine learning. 
I am currently helping [Cambridge Medical Robotics](http://murmure.org/.html) carry out their awesome work and learn how to do proper engineering in the process.

If you have any questions please feel free to get in touch.
