I recently completed my Master's in Infomration Engineering at the University of Cambridge. I'm currently at [Cambridge Medical Robotics](http://cmedrobotics.com/) learning how to be an Engineer.

My research interests lie in carrying out visumotor tasks autonomously, understanding and operating in unstructured environments, so I'm into control theory, deep learning, reinforcement learning and computer vision. My creative work is somewhat similar, balancing order and disorder aesthetically.
